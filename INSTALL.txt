Installing SeqMonk
-------------------
SeqMonk is a java application.  In order to run it needs your system to have a suitable
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.  Before you try to run SeqMonk you should therefore
ensure that you have a suitable JRE. Becuse of it's use of the HTSJDK library SeqMonk requires
the use of java 8 (also cofusingly called java 1.8) or later.

Free versions of java are available for a number of different platforms from www.java.com.
When downloading DON'T just use the download link on the front page, but click on the smaller
link to "See all java downloads", and make sure that if you are on a 64 bit system you get
the 64 bit JVM.

If you are on a Mac you will be promoted to go to the Oracle download page.  SeqMonk requires
that the command line version of java is installed and on the latest versions of java for 
OSX that means that you need to install the Java SE Development kit.  Installing just the 
Java SE Runtime Environment is NOT ENOUGH.

If you're not sure whether you have java installed then you can test this from a command
prompt.  To get a command prompt try:

Windows: Select Start > Run, and type 'cmd' (no quotes) in the box which appears, press OK

MaxOSX: Run Applications > Utilities > Terminal

Linux: You should find a program called Terminal or KTerm in your applications menu

At the command prompt type 'java -version' and press enter.  You should see something like:

	java version "1.8.0_60"
	Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_60-b27)
	Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.60-b23, mixed mode)

If you get an error then you don't have java installed.  If the version listed on the first
line is less than 1.8 then you won't be able to run SeqMonk without updating your JRE.

If you are running Fedora then although you see something like this SeqMonk still won't run 
because the version of java which is installed by default doesn't include any of the graphical 
libraries.  You will need to install the full version of openjdk which will be something like:

sudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk

(that's for Fedora 27 - the exact name might change on different versions, but it's the same idea)

Actually installing SeqMonk is as simple as unzipping the zip file it comes in into a
suitable location.  That's it.  Once unzipped it's ready to go.


Running SeqMonk
----------------
Windows: Simply double click on the seqmonk.exe file.

NB for Windows 8 users: Windows 8 ships a newer version of the Microsoft .NET framework
which seqmonk uses to launch the main java program.  If you find the program won't
launch and you're getting errors like 

'Could not load assembly System, Version=2.0.0.0'

..then the fix is to go to:

Control Panel > Programs and Features > Turn windows features on or off

..and turn on the '.NET Framework 3.5' option.  This will install the older windows
libraries and the launcher should work again.


MacOSX: There is an application bundle for MacOSX which you can use to install and run
SeqMonk.

Linux:  You can use the seqmonk wrapper program to launch the program.  You will need to
make this file executable (chmod 755 seqmonk), and then ./seqmonk will launch the program.
If you link (don't copy) the seqmonk file into /usr/local/bin then you will be able to run
the program from anywhere on your system.  We have also included a seqmonk.desktop file
which you can use to register seqmonk with your desktop environment.  If you have put
the whole SeqMonk folder into /usr/local then you can simply copy the seqmonk.desktop file
to /usr/local/share/applications.  If you installed it elsewhere you'll need to edit the
paths in the desktop file (it's pretty obvious what to edit), and then copy the file to
the applications folder.


Configuring SeqMonk
--------------------
Before starting out using SeqMonk you may want to review the configuration options you
have for the program.  Information about configuration can be found in the help which 
comes with the program under Help > Contents > Configuration.

In particular you must set up a cache directory in order to allow the analysis of all
but the smallest of datasets.  Simply create a folder somewhere on your machine you are
able to temporarily write large amounts of data, and then use the button of the front
screen of seqmonk to tell it where to find this folder.


Configuring R
-------------
For some of the advanced statistical filters SeqMonk talks to a locally installed instance
of R to do the statistical analysis.  Configuring R is optional, and SeqMonk will run 
without it, but the R based filters will not be available.

To configure SeqMonk and R you first need to install R on your system.  R can be downloaded
from http://www.r-project.org/ and you should follow the instructions there to load it.

For OSX and Linux users the installation of some R packages will require that you have 
suitable development tools installed.  For OSX the easiest way to get these is to install the
OSX R Tools Package which can be found at:

https://github.com/coatless/r-macos-rtools

For Linux users you should install the normal build environment on your sytem.  Many systems
will have this already, but you can explicitly install them with:

Ubuntu: sudo apt install build-essential

CentOS: sudo yum groupinstall "Development tools"

In addition you may need to install some additional development libraries.  The exact set 
can change over time, but the one which often crops up is the xml2-dev library

Ubuntu: sudo apt install libxml2-dev

CentOS: sudo yum install libxml2-devel

SeqMonk should prompt you to identify the location of your R installation (if it's not
found automatically), and will attempt to install any packages it requires for you during
initial setup.
