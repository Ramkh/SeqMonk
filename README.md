# SeqMonk
SeqMonk is a desktop application for the visualisation and analysis of large mapped genomic datasets, normally coming from high througput sequencing.

It is useful for the analysis of any experiment type which produces sets of mapped positions relating to a reference genome.  This would include (but is not limited to)

* RNA-Seq
* ChIP-Seq
* BS-Seq
* HiC

This project page contains the source code for the application and is useful only to people wanting to develop new functionality in SeqMonk.  If you just want to run the program then you want to go to the [**project web page**](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/) where you can download the normal desktop pacakges for Windows, OSX and Linux.
